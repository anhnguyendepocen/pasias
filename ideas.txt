Ideas for Problems and Solutions in Applied Statistics (in R)

Use section for chapter, subsection for problem, subsubsection for
statement of problem or part, subsubsubsection for solution? Or
solution in quote?

How to handle question parts?

Translate from .Rnw to some intermediate text, and from there to R
Markdown for bookdown. 

\begin{select}: ignore
\begin{solution}: right heading
\emph{}: **
\texttt{}: ``
\textbf{}: ** **
<<>>=: ```{r}
@: ```

\end{}: ignore

numbering sections:
---
title: "My Report"
output: 
  html_document:
    number_sections: true
---

question titles: add %% comment to beginning of file, and change Perl
to replace \question with blank.
