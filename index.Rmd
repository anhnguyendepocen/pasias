description: "A set of problems and solutions, in R, on various parts of applied statistics"
---

# Introduction

This book will hold a collection of problems, and their solutions, in applied statistics with R. These come from my courses STAC32 and STAD29 at the University of Toronto Scarborough.

The problems were originally written in Sweave (that is, LaTeX with R code chunks), using the `exam` document class. I wrote a Perl program to strip out the LaTeX and turn each problem into R Markdown for this book. You will undoubtedly see bits of LaTeX still embedded in the text. I am trying to update my program to catch them, but I am sure to miss some. If you see anything, [file an issue](https://github.com/nxskok/pasias/issues) on the Github page for now. I want to fix problems programmatically at first, but when the majority of the problems have been caught, I will certainly take pull requests. I will acknowledge all the people who catch things.

Current progress: 5 chapters (up to one-sample inference), but the problems in chapters 4 and 5 don't have titles yet. (I want to fix up my Perl to catch some more latexery, and when I am happy with that, the problems will get titles.)
