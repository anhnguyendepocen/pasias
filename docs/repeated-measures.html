<p>Box (1950) gives data on the weights of three groups of
rats. One group was given thyroxin in their drinking water, one group
thiouracil, and the third group was a control. (This description comes
from Christensen (2001).)

<p>There are 27 rats altogether, each measured five times (labelled time
0 through 4).</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Why would it be <em>wrong</em> to use something like
<code>gather</code> to create one column of weights, and separate
columns of drug and time, and then to run a two-way ANOVA? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Such a solution would assume that we have measurements on
<em>different</em> rats, one for each drug-time combination. But we
have sets of five measurements all on the <em>same</em> rat: that is
to say, we have repeated measures, and the proper analysis will
take that into account.</p>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Create a suitable response variable and fit a suitable
<code>lm</code> as the first step of the repeated-measures analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The response variable is the same idea as for any MANOVA: just
glue the columns together:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3502"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3502-1" data-line-number="1">response &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">with</span>(weights, <span class="kw">cbind</span>(Time0, Time1, Time2, Time3, Time4))</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3502-2" data-line-number="2">weights<span class="fl">.1</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">lm</span>(response <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>drug, <span class="dt">data =</span> weights)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>Now, we <em>don’t</em> look at <code>weights.1</code>, but we <em>do</em> use
it as input to <code>Manova</code> in a moment.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Load the package <code>car</code> and run a suitable
<code>Manova</code>. To do this, you will need to set up the right thing
for <code>idata</code> and <code>idesign</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3503"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3503-1" data-line-number="1">times &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">colnames</span>(response)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3503-2" data-line-number="2">times.df &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">data.frame</span>(times)</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3503-3" data-line-number="3">weights<span class="fl">.2</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">Manova</span>(weights<span class="fl">.1</span>, <span class="dt">idata =</span> times.df, <span class="dt">idesign =</span> <span class="op">~</span>times)</a></code></pre></div>
<p>The thought process is that the columns of the response
(<code>Time.0</code> through <code>Time.4</code>) are all times. This is the
“within-subject design” part of it: within a rat, the different
response values are at different times. That’s the only part of it
that is within subjects. The different drugs are a
“between-subjects” factor: each rat only gets one of the
drugs.
<label for="tufte-mn-197" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-197" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Things would be a lot more complicated if each rat got a different drug at a different time! But the rats each got one drug <em>once</em>, at the beginning, and the issue was the effect of that drug on all the growth that followed.</span></p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Take a look at the output from the MANOVA. Is there a
significant interaction? What does its significance (or lack
thereof) mean?</li>
</ol>

<p>The interaction is definitely significant, with a P-value of
0.00069. This means that the effect of time on growth is different for
the different drugs: that is, the effect of drug is over the whole
time profile, not just something like
“a rat on Thyroxin is on average 10 grams heavier than a control rat, over all times”.</p>
<p>Since the interaction is significant, that’s where we stop, as far as
interpretation is concerned.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>We are going to draw an interaction plot in a moment. To
set that up, use <code>gather</code> as in the lecture notes to create
one column of weights and a second column of times. (You don’t

if you want to try it, go ahead.)</li>

<ol start="8" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How does this plot show why the interaction was
significant? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>At the beginning, all the rats have the same average growth, but
from time 2 (or maybe even 1) or so, the rats on thiouracil
grew more slowly. The idea is not just that thiouracil has a
<em>constant</em> effect over all times, but that the <em>pattern</em>
of growth is different for the different drugs: whether or not
thiouracil inhibits growth, and, if so, by how much, depends on
what time point you are looking at.</p>
<p>Rats on thyroxin or the control drug grew at pretty much the same
rate over all times, so I wouldn’t concern myself with any
differences there.</p>
<p>What I thought would be interesting is to plot the growth curves for
<em>all</em> the rats individually, colour-coded by which drug the rat
was on. This is the repeated-measures version of the ANOVA interaction
plot with the data on it. (We don’t use the lines for the means, here,
instead using them for joining the measurements belonging to the same
subject.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s a bit of data awkwardness, because we need
to know which rat is which when we plot them. To do that, we need
to go all the way back to <code>weights</code> and introduce a
subject-number variable. This suggests a chain of
things. There are 27 rats altogether. First we take the original
data frame <code>weights</code> with each row being one rat, and we
add a variable <code>subject</code> which is 1 through 27. Then we
gather together the columns <code>Time0</code> through
<code>Time4</code> that are different <code>time</code>s but all
<code>weight</code>s, like we did before. Optionally, we can also
<code>separate</code> <code>Time.x</code> into the <code>Time</code> part and
the <code>x</code> part (<code>x</code> being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4), but I won’t
do that here. Then we save the result into a new data frame
<code>wt</code>, and take a look at the first few lines:</p>

<p>After going through that, the logic of the actual plotting part is
pretty straightforward. In the data frame <code>wt</code>, we plot
<code>time</code> (<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) against <code>weight</code> (<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>), grouping the points
according to subject and colouring them according to
<code>drug</code>.</p>

<p>This is often called, rather aptly, a “spaghetti plot”.</p>
<p>I like this plot because, unlike the interaction plot, which shows
only means, this gives a sense of variability as well. The blue and
red lines (thyroxin and control) are all intermingled and they go
straight up. So there is nothing to choose between these. The green
lines, though, start off mixed up with the red and blue ones but
finish up at the bottom: the <em>pattern</em> of growth of the
thiouracil rats is different from the others, which is why we had a
significant interaction between drug and time.</p>
<p><code>drug</code> is categorical, so <code>ggplot</code>
uses a set of distinguishable colours to mark the levels. If our
colour had been a numerical variable, <code>ggplot</code> would have used
a range of colours like light blue to dark blue, with lighter being
higher, for example.</p>
<p>What, you want to see that? All right. This one is kind of silly, but
you see the point:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3518"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3518-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(wt, <span class="kw">aes</span>(time, weight, <span class="dt">group =</span> subject, <span class="dt">colour =</span> weight)) <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">geom_line</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="20-repeated-measures_files/figure-html/alphington-1.png" width="576"  /></p>
<p>The line segments get lighter as you go up the page.</p>
<p>Since we went to the trouble of making the “long” data frame
<code>wt</code>, we can also run a repeated measures analysis using the
mixed-model idea (described more fully in the problem of the children
near the new airport):</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">24.2</span> Social interaction among old people</h2>
<p>A graduate student wrote a thesis comparing different
treatments for increasing social interaction among geriatric
patients. He recruited 21 patients at a state mental hospital and
randomly assigned them to treatments: Reality Orientation
(<code>ro</code>), Behavior Therapy (<code>bt</code>) or no treatment
(<code>ctrl</code>). Each subject was observed at four times, labelled
<code>t1</code> through <code>t4</code> in the data file
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/geriatrics.txt">link</a>. The
response variable was the percentage of time that the subject was
“engaging in the relevant social interaction”, so that a higher
value is better.</p>
<p>The principal aim of the study was to see whether there were
differences among the treatments (one would hope that the real
treatments were better than the control one), and whether there were
any patterns over time.</p>

<p>The interaction is significant, so the effects of the treatments are
different at different times. (It makes most sense to say it this way
around, since treatment is something that was controlled and time was not.)</p>

<p>I had to think a bit about “what makes the gathered columns the same”.
They are all percentages of interactions of a specific type,
so you could as well (or better) call them “percent”.</p>
<p>Anyway, I have <em>one</em> column of interaction percents, and
<em>one</em> column of times. If you check the whole thing, you’ll see
that you get all the time-1 measurements first, then all the time-2
measurements, and so on, so that the subject number loops through the
21 subjects four times.</p>

<p>The two “real” treatments <code>bt</code> and <code>ro</code> both go up
sharply between time 1 and time 2, and then come back down so that
by time 4 they are about where they started. The control group
basically didn’t change at all, and if anything went <em>down</em>
between times 1 and 2, a completely different pattern to the others.
The two treatments <code>bt</code> and <code>ro</code> are not exactly
parallel, but they do at least have qualitatively the same
pattern.

I’m going to explore that some more later, but first I want to get
you to draw a spaghetti plot.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Draw a spaghetti plot of these data. That is, use
<code>ggplot</code> to plot the interaction percent against time for
each subject,
joining the points for the <em>same subject</em> by lines whose colour
shows what treatment they were on. Use the “long” data frame for
this (not the data frame of means).</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>This is almost easier to do than it is to ask you to do:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3536"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3536-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">ggplot</span>(geriatrics.long, <span class="kw">aes</span>(<span class="dt">x =</span> time, <span class="dt">y =</span> intpct, <span class="dt">colour =</span> treatment, <span class="dt">group =</span> subject)) <span class="op">+</span></a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3536-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="st">  </span><span class="kw">geom_line</span>()</a></code></pre></div>
<p><img src="20-repeated-measures_files/figure-html/ger_spag-1.png" width="672"  /></p>
<p>The basic difficulty here is to get all the parts. We need both a
<code>colour</code> and a <code>group</code>; the latter controls the joining
of points by lines (if you have both). Fortunately we already had
subject numbers in the original data; if we had not had them, we would
have had to create them. <code>dplyr</code> has a function
<code>row_number</code> that we could have used for that; we’d apply the row
numbers to the original wide data frame, before we made it long, so
that the correct subject numbers would get carried along.</p>
<p>Whether you add a <code>geom_point()</code> to plot the data points, or not,
is up to you. Logically, it makes sense to include the actual data,
but aesthetically, it looks more like spaghetti if you leave the
points out. Either way is good, as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p>I didn’t ask you to comment on the spaghetti plot, because the story
is much the same as the interaction plot. There is a lot of
variability, but the story within each group is basically what we
already said: the red lines go sharply up and almost as sharply back
down again, the blue lines do something similar, only not as sharply
up and down, and the green lines do basically nothing.</p>
<p>I said that the control subjects’ time pattern was noticeably
different from the others. Which made me think: what if we remove the
control subjects? Would there still be an interaction?

<p>There is still an interaction, but it’s not as significant as it was
before. I think it is still significant because the shape of the two
time trends is not the same: the red <code>bt</code> group goes up further
and down further. I was musing that the higher values are also more
variable, which would suggest a transformation, but I haven’t explored that.
If the interaction had turned out to be nonsignificant this way? You
might think about trying to remove it from the model, except that in
this kind of model, <code>treatment</code> is a “between-subjects factor”
and <code>times</code> is a “within-subjects factor”, so they
are different kinds of things. What you do in that case is to ignore
the non-significant interaction and interpret the main effects: there
is no way to “gain df for error” like we did in two-way
ANOVA. Supposing, in this case, that we were using <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.01\)</span>, we
would say that the interaction is not significant. Then we look at the
main effects: there is no effect of treatment, but there is an effect
of time. Or, to put it another way, once you allow for an effect of
time, there is no difference between the two remaining
treatments.
<label for="tufte-mn-202" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-202" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">There is often an effect of time, which is why you would be taking multiple time measurements, but the issue is when you take that into account, you are giving yourself an improved chance, in general, to find a treatment effect. This is exactly the same idea as using a matched pairs design to give yourself an improved chance of finding a treatment effect, even though the subjects might be quite different from each other. In fact, repeated measures <em>is</em> matched pairs with more than two measurements on each person. Which makes me think, I should have you do a matched pairs as repeated measures.</span></p>
<p>Thinking back to our spaghetti plot, we are now comparing the red and
blue treatments. They both go up at time 2 and down afterwards, which
is the time effect, but even once you allow for this time trend, there is
too much scatter to be able to infer a difference between the treatments.</p>
<p>Extra (maybe branch off into another question?) I was thinking that this is not terribly clear, so I thought I would
fake up some data where there is a treatment effect and a time effect
(but no interaction), and draw a spaghetti plot, so you can see the
difference, idealized somewhat of course. Let’s try to come up with
something with the same kind of time effect, up at time 2 and then
down afterwards, that is the same for two drugs A and B. Here’s what I
came up with:</p>

<p>You can kind of get the idea that the pattern over time is up and then
down, so that it finishes about where it starts, but the numbers for
drug A are usually bigger than the ones for drug B, consistently over
time. So there ought not to be an interaction, but there ought to be
both a time effect and a drug effect.</p>
<p>Let’s see whether we can demonstrate that. First, a spaghetti plot,
which involves getting the data in long format first. I’m saving the
long format to use again later.</p>

<p>The reds are consistently higher than the blues (drug effect), the
pattern over time goes up and then down (time effect), but the time
effect is basically the same for both drugs (no interaction).</p>
<p>I got the plot wrong the first time, because I forgot whether I was
doing an interaction plot (where <code>group=</code> and <code>colour=</code>
are the same) or a spaghetti plot (where <code>group</code> has to be

<p>After typing this kind of stuff out a few too many times, I hope
you’re getting the idea “function”. Also, the construction of the
response is kind of annoying, where you have to list all the time
columns. The trouble is, <code>response</code> has to be a <code>matrix</code>,
which it is:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3548"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3548-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="kw">class</span>(response)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;matrix&quot;</code></pre>
<p>but if you do the obvious thing of selecting the columns of the data
frame that you want:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3550"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3550-1" data-line-number="1">fake <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(t1<span class="op">:</span>t4) -&gt;<span class="st"> </span>r</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3550-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">class</span>(r)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;data.frame&quot;</code></pre>
<p>you get a data frame instead. I think this would work:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3552"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3552-1" data-line-number="1">r &lt;-<span class="st"> </span>fake <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">select</span>(t1<span class="op">:</span>t4) <span class="op">%&gt;%</span><span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">as.matrix</span>()</a>
<a class="sourceLine" id="cb3552-2" data-line-number="2"><span class="kw">class</span>(r)</a></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;matrix&quot;</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that you select the columns you want as a data frame first
(with <code>select</code>), and then turn it into a <code>matrix</code> at the
end.</p>
<p>This is the kind of thing you’d have to do in a function, I think,
since you’d have to have some way of telling the function which are
the “time” columns. Anyway, hope you haven’t forgotten what we were
doing:

<p>The drug-by-time interaction is not (quite) significant, so working at
<span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span> (since that will help me make my point), we go ahead and
interpret the main effects: there is a time effect (the increase at
time 2 that I put in on purpose), and, allowing for the time effect,
there is also a difference between the drugs (because the drug A
scores are a bit higher than the drug B scores).</p>

<p>but this would be <em>wrong</em>, because we are acting as if we have 40
independent observations, which we don’t (this is the point of doing
repeated measures in the first place). It looks as if we have achieved
something by getting a lower P-value for <code>drug</code>, but we
haven’t really, because we have done so by cheating.</p>

<p>Ah, now, this is very interesting. I was hoping that by throwing away
the time information (which is useful), we would have diminished
the significance of the drug effect. By failing to include the
time-dependence in our model, we ought to have introduced some extra
variability, which ought to weaken our test. But this test gives
<em>exactly the same</em> P-value as the one in the MANOVA, and it looks
like exactly the same test (the <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>-value is the same too). So it
looks as if this is what the MANOVA is doing, to assess the
<code>drug</code> effect: it’s averaging over the times. Since the same
four (here) time points are being used to compute the average for each
subject, we are comparing like with like at least, and even if there
is a large time effect, I suppose it’s going to have the same effect
on each average. For example, if as here the scores at time 2 are
typically highest, all the averages are going to be composed of one
high score and three lower ones. So maybe I have to go back and dilute
my conclusions about the significance of treatments earlier: it’s actually
saying that there is a difference between the two remaining treatments
<em>averaged over time</em> rather than <em>allowing for time</em> as I
said earlier.</p>
<p>The data in
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/airport.txt">link</a> are based on
a 1998 study of stress levels in children as a result of the building
of a new airport in Munich, Germany. A total of 200 children had their
epinephrine levels (a stress indicator) measured at each of four
different times: before the airport was built, and 6, 18 and 36 months
after it was built. The four measurements are labelled <code>epi_1</code>
through <code>epi_4</code>. Out of the children, 100 were living near
the new airport (location 1 in the data set), and could be expected to
suffer stress because of the new airport. The other 100 children lived
in the same city, but outside the noise impact zone. These children
thus serve as a control group. The children are identified with
numbers 1 through 200.</p>
<p>As with the spaghetti-plot question about throwing baseballs and
softballs, see if you can build a pipe, one step at a time.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If we were testing for the effect of time, explain briefly
what it is about the structure of the data that would make an
analysis of variance <em>inappropriate</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>It is the fact that each child was measured four times, rather
than each measurement being on a <em>different</em> child (with
thus <span class="math inline">\(4\times 200=800\)</span> observations altogether). It’s
the same distinction as between matched pairs and a two-sample
<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> test (and thus the previous question was a big hint for this
one).
Extra: data in this form are called “repeated measures”, and
analysing them as if they were on different individuals is wrong
because children are likely to be different from each other:
some children are likely to be high at all times and some
low. There is extra information in knowing that the sets of four
measurements are each on the same child. The analysis is beyond
our scope at the moment, but if you take D29, you’ll see it
there.</p>

<p>Your choice of names is not important, though it should be something
reminiscent of what the columns actually represent. (For me, I want to
reserve the name <code>time</code> for later, which is why I used the name
<code>when</code> here.)</p>
<p>The one thing we have to fix up is that the time column is not 1
through 4, but <code>epi_1</code> through <code>epi_4</code>. That’s what we
tackle next.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Find a way to create a new column containing just the number
of the time point, and save the resulting data frame. (Two options
you can explore: <code>parse_number</code> combined with

<p>The job of <code>separate</code> is to split a
column, which currently contains two things mashed together, into two separate
columns. The syntax is: column to separate, names of
columns to create, and character to split at (underscore, here). The
result is that <code>when</code> has disappeared, and two new columns have
been created: <code>junk</code> which contains the text <code>epi</code> from
before the underscore and <code>time</code> which contains the number
after the underscore (the number of the time point).
This appears to have worked, but look at the top of the columns.
<code>time</code> is not actually a number, but is still text (because
<code>when</code> was text). There is an option on <code>separate</code> that
will fix that, if you want to:</p>

<p>What <code>convert</code> does is to look at the columns of output and see
what they look like. <code>time</code> looked like numbers, so it was
converted to numbers, while <code>junk</code> is unmistakably text, so
that’s what it stays.</p>
<p>It turns out that the time can be either text or a number and the
spaghetti plot will still work, so that the <code>convert</code> above is
not necessary (it just makes things look prettier). I think what
happens is that if the numbers are not equally spaced, like 1, 2, 4,
8, having them be numbers will plot them unequally spaced as they
should be, but if they are text, they will be spaced out equally
across the plot.</p>
<p>From here on, I’m going to use the data frame that I
made using <code>parse_number</code>, but of course if you prefer to use
the output from <code>separate</code>, use that instead. The relevant
issue is the stuff you add to the end of your pipe each time.</p>

<p>R actually does have over 200 different colours, but they are rather
hard to tell apart. The major benefit to the colours here is so that
you can track the same child across the picture. Or you would be able
to, if it were not for the huge legend. The one value of the legend is
that it shows you that the brown and green kids are the low-numbered
ones from location 1, and the blue and pink ones are the high-numbered
ones from location 2.</p>
<p>This seems not to work if you take out the <code>geom_point</code>. I’m
not sure why: it gives (for me) an error message that is not very
informative.</p>
<p>Does it work if you use a data frame from earlier where the times
were text rather than numbers, and called <code>when</code>?</p>

<p>Yes it does. So you could either use <code>separate</code> earlier (with
or without <code>convert</code>), or you could use
<code>parse_number</code>, and it would work equally well. I happen to
like <code>parse_number</code>, but that’s a personal preference.</p>
<p>The perhaps smarter way to do it, rather than repeating
<code>factor(child)</code>, is to define the factor version of
<code>child</code> first, in the pipe:</p>

<p>I showed you how to do this in a previous question.
The title at the top of my huge legend is
<code>factor(child)</code>, or <code>fchild</code> if you did
it that way. That appears after <code>colour=</code> in
the <code>aes</code>, so <code>colour</code> is the thing that

are, depending on your tastes, more variable, have a
higher mean, usually increase from time 1 to the
other time points, or are potentially higher in
terms of epinephrine. (I’d take any of those.)
The location 2 children were our control group;
their stress levels should not have been affected by
the building of the airport, since they weren’t
close to it. So we’d expect to see, and do see,
consistent levels over time. The location 1
children, however, were the ones potentially
affected by the building of the airport. It looks as
if the building of the airport is associated with
“potentially higher”, “typically higher”,
“increased” or “more variable” stress levels
(whatever words you used above). Unless there is
something different about the children who live near
the new airport (apart from the fact that they live
near the new airport), it looks as if the new
airport is having a bad effect on their stress
levels. This is distressing, but not exactly a
surprise.
As for any effect on stress levels over time, there
is not much especially consistent coming out of the
spaghetti plot that I can see. Maybe the stress
levels at the first time point, before the airport
was built, are lower than the ones after that on average.
(If you find something like this and it looks
justifiable, it’s good.)</p>
<p>How can we predict an individual’s body fat? Physiologists
measured body fat for 20 individuals, along with three other
quantitative measurements: triceps skinfold thickness, thigh
circumference and midarm circumference. (Measuring body fat requires a
special device, but the other variables are easy to measure and might
give a good estimate of body fat.) The data can be found at
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/bodyfat2.txt">link</a>. The data
values are separated by <em>tabs</em>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Read in (to SAS) and display the data. (You may display all
the data.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
Something like this. Remember the <code>delimiter</code> line that
you need for tabs:

<p>As indicated, 20 observations, and all the variables
quantitative.</p>
<ol start="2" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Fit a regression predicting body fat from all the other
variables.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<code>proc reg</code>, nothing very surprising:

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>What is R-squared for this regression? Look at the P-values
for the individual explanatory variables. Does this seem surprising?
Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>R-squared is about 80% (0.8014), decently high. But <em>none</em>
of the explanatory variables are significant; the lowest P-value
is 0.1699. This seems surprising because if the regression fits
reasonably well, as this one does, you would expect at least one
of the explanatory variables to be significant. (The reason, if
you wish to make a guess, is that at least two of the explanatory
variables are highly correlated with each other, so that we
don’t know which one deserves the “credit” for predicting body
fat. We’ll explore this later.)
SAS is not case sensitive, so you don’t need those Initial
Capital Letters on the variable names.
I would have guessed that larger body fat would go with larger
measurements on the other variables, so I would have expected
those slopes to be positive. We’ll keep an eye on this.</p>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Remove the least significant explanatory variable from your
regression. What has happened to the P-values for the other
explanatory variables?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
This means fitting a model without <code>Thigh</code>. SAS doesn’t
have <code>update</code>, so this means copying and pasting your
code and deleting <code>Thigh</code>:

The P-values for the remaining two explanatory variables have
become (much) smaller. In particular, the P-value for
<code>Triceps</code> is now <em>strongly</em> significant.
This suggests that <code>Triceps</code> was strongly correlated with
the variable <code>Thigh</code> that we removed. We can investigate this:

<p>That’s a decently strong correlation: when one variable is high,
the other one is too. That’s why it was difficult for the
regression to decide which of <code>Thigh</code> and
<code>Triceps</code> deserved to stay.
I note that the slope for
<code>Midarm</code> is still negative, and now significant, so it
really does seem to be true that if you have a larger midarm
circumference, you have <em>less</em> body fat, all else (triceps
skinfold thickness) being equal.</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Make any other changes you would like to make to your
regression model, or explain briefly why you are happy with the
model as it stands.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Both of the remaining explanatory variables are now significant,
so it would be a mistake to remove either of them. We are
therefore happy with the model as it stands.
(This statement is really only worth one point, but I didn’t
want to give it away: if you thought you needed to fit another
model and that had been correct, you would have deserved two
points for doing it.)</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>For your preferred model, critically assess whether your
residuals are (i) approximately random with respect to suitable
things and (ii) approximately normal. You probably already have the
output you need to investigate this. What do your conclusions tell
you about your regression?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>It’s those graphs from the last regression you did:

On the first <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3\)</span> “panel”, look at the top left
graph. This is the plot of residuals against fitted values. It
is pretty much a random scatter. Also look at the last two
plots; these are the residuals against the two remaining
explanatory variables, and they both look random as well. (The
one on the left, against <code>Triceps</code>, is pretty much a
textbook random scatter).
This all says that the residuals are random relative to anything
relevant, or to say it another way, there is no remaining
pattern that we need to incorporate in the model. To assess the
residuals for normality, look at the normal quantile plot, which
is the first plot on the second row of the <span class="math inline">\(3\times 3\)</span>
array.
The normal quantile plot is basically straight, I would say,
with those wiggles being inconsequential ones, not indicative of
any kind of curve. If the distribution had short tails, there
would be a rather more pronounced S-shape than you see here.
The bottom left plot of the <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3\)</span> array is a histogram of
the residuals. This does not look very normal, but, as we have
seen, the histogram is rather a crude tool for assessing
normality.
Concluding, as we have, that there are no problems with the
residuals means that the regression is satisfactory; it does a
good job of describing the shape of the relationship. So we
should be happy to use this regression to predict body fat of
future individuals based on their triceps and midarm
measurements.</p>

<div id="investigating-motor-activity-in-rats" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">24.3</span> Investigating motor activity in rats</h2>
<p>A researcher named King was investigating
the effect of the drug midazolam on motor activity in rats. Typically,
the first time the drug is injected, a rat’s motor activity decreases
substantially, but rats typically develop a “tolerance”, so that
further injections of the drug have less impact on the rat’s motor
activity.</p>
<p>The data shown in
<a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/king.csv">link</a> were all taken
in one day, called the “experiment day” below. 24 different rats
were used. Each rat, on the experiment day, was injected with a fixed
amount of midazolam, and at each of six five-minute intervals after
being injected, the rat’s motor activity was measured (these are
labelled <code>i1</code> through <code>i6</code> in the data). The rats
differed in how they had been treated before the experiment day. The
control group of rats had previously been injected repeatedly with a
saline solution (no active ingredient), so the experiment day was the
first time this group of rats had received midazolam. The other two
groups of rats had both received midazolam repeatedly before the
experiment day: the “same” group was injected on experiment day in
the same environment that the previous injections had taken place (this
is known in psychology as a “conditioned tolerance”), but the
“different” group had the previous injections in a different
environment than on experiment day.</p>
<p>The column <code>id</code> identifies the rat from which each sequence of
values was obtained.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Explain briefly why we need to use a repeated measures
analysis for these data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Each rat is measured at six different times (<code>i1</code> through
<code>i6</code>): that is to say, each row of the data set consists of
repeated measurements on the <em>same</em> rat. (If each row had
used six <em>different</em> rats to obtain the six measurements, we
would have been back in familiar territory and could have used a

<p>This seems to illustrate the same things as I found on the spaghetti
plot. It gains in clarity by only looking at means, but loses by not
considering the variability. Your call.</p>
<p>This kind of thing also runs with <code>lmer</code> from package
<code>lme4</code>. It uses the long data frame, thus, treating <code>id</code>
(identifying the rats) as a random effect:</p>

<p>and we get the same conclusion as before, but with a much smaller P-value.</p>
<p>With this kind of modelling, there is no distinction between
“within” and “between”, so that even though <code>time</code> is a
within-subjects factor and <code>context</code> is between subjects, if
the interaction had not been significant, we could have dropped it
from the model, and then we would have had an effect of <code>time</code>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">24.4</span> Repeated measures with no background</h2>
<p>Nine people are randomly chosen to receive one of three
treatments, labelled A, B and C. Each person has their response
<code>y</code> to the treatment measured at three times, labelled T1, T2
and T3. The main aim of the study is to properly assess the effects of
the treatments. A higher value of <code>y</code> is better.</p>
<p>The data are in <a href="http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/d29/rm.txt">link</a>.</p>

<p>Solution</p>
<p>There are only 9 people with 3 observations on each person. The
three observations on the same person are likely to be correlated
with each other, and so treating them as independent would be a
mistake.
This is repeated-measures data. If you say that, that’s useful,
but you also need to demonstrate that you know what repeated
measures <em>means</em> and why it needs to be handled differently
from one-observation-per-individual data. Another way to look at
it is that individuals will differ from each other, and so there
ought to be an “individual” effect included in the model, in the
same way that you would include a block effect in a randomized
block design: not because you care about differences among
individuals, but because you are pretty sure they’ll be there and
you want to account for them.</p>

<p>Find a way to display what you have, so you can decide whether it is
tidy or not.
Each observation of <code>y</code> is in a row by itself, so this is
tidy, or long format. You might even call this extra-tidy, because
each person is spread over three rows, one for each time point.
Looking ahead, this is ideal for making a graph, or for doing the
advanced version of the analysis with <code>lme4</code>, but it is not
so good for our MANOVA way of doing a repeated measures

<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>On your spaghetti plot, how do the values of <code>y</code> for
the treatments compare over time?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The most obvious thing is that the values of <code>y</code> <em>all</em>
go up over time, regardless of which treatment they were from.
At the initial time T1, the treatments are all about the same, but
at the second and third time points, <code>y</code> is bigger for
treatment C than for the other two treatments (which are about the
same as each other). If you like, say that the gap between
treatment C and the others is increasing over time, or that the
lines for treatment C are steeper than for the other
treatments. Any of those ways of saying it comes to the same
conclusion.
Extra: if you look at the lines of the same colour (treatment),
they don’t seem to cross over very much. That suggests that an
individual who starts with a larger value of <code>y</code>
(relatively, compared to the other individuals on the same
treatment) tends to stay larger than the other individuals on the
same treatment all the way through. This would be another thing
you’d see if the measurements for the individuals are correlated,
or if there is an “individual effect” to go along with a
treatment effect (and a time effect).
If you think of this like an individual-level version of an
interaction plot (which would be obtained by plotting the
<em>means</em> for each treatment at each time), there is a
suggestion here of an interaction between treatment and time, as
well as a treatment effect (the latter because treatment C appears
better than the rest).</p>
<ol start="5" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Explain briefly how the data are in the wrong format for a
repeated-measures ANOVA (done using MANOVA, as in class), and use
<code>spread</code> to get the data set into the right format. (Hint:
there is an example of <code>spread</code> in assignment 2.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>For MANOVA, we want the three responses (here, the values of
<code>y</code> at the three different times) in three separate
columns, with <em>all</em> the measurements for one subject in one
row (rather than on three separate rows, as here).
<code>spread</code> is the flip-side of <code>gather</code>: instead of
making different columns that all measure the same thing into one
column, we split one column that contains things that are slightly
different from each other (here, <code>y</code> at different
times). It needs two inputs: the current single column that
contains the column names you are going to make, and the values to
carry along with them, in that order:</p>

<p>Note that the <code>time</code> and <code>y</code> columns have
<em>disappeared</em>: the columns labelled with the time points are
where those values of <code>y</code> have gone. The nine subjects make up
the nine rows of the new “wide” data set, which is in the format we
want.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Run a repeated-measures ANOVA the <code>Manova</code> way. What do you
conclude from it?</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>Create the response variable first, and use it in an <code>lm</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3617"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3617-1" data-line-number="1">response &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">with</span>(tr2, <span class="kw">cbind</span>(T1, T2, T3))</a>

<p>Now we have to construct the within-subject stuff, for which we need
to get the different times we have. You can type them in again (fine
here), or get them from the <code>response</code> you just made:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3618"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3618-1" data-line-number="1">times &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">colnames</span>(response)</a>

<p>This is where the possible time effect is accounted for. Because time
is within-subjects (each subject is measured at several different
times) but treatment is between subjects (each subject only gets one
treatment), the two things have to be treated separately, in this
approach at least.</p>

<p>What is all that about? Start in the middle, with Mauchly’s test, the
one with a P-value of 0.049. One of the assumptions of a
repeated-measures ANOVA is of a special kind of equal spreads: that
all comparisons of pairs of treatments have the same variance. This is
called sphericity. Sphericity is a hard thing to judge unless we have
a test to do it with, such as Mauchly’s test. This one is on the
borderline: do we reject sphericity or not? If you reject sphericity,
you can’t trust the results of the MANOVA. So let’s assume that we
<em>do</em> reject sphericity. What we do next is to look down the
bottom at the two “corrections for departure from sphericity”. One
is due to Greenhouse and Geisser, the other to Huynh and Feldt. I
don’t have any suggestions for choosing between them, so the thing to
do is to see whether they agree with each other. The two P-values for
testing the interaction are 0.008 and 0.006, which are a bit bigger
than before, but still definitely significant. So, whether we believe
sphericity or not, there is an interaction between treatment and
time. If this is your analysis, you make impressive-sounding
pronouncements like
“the significance of the interaction is robust to sphericity”.</p>
<ol start="7" style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>How is your conclusion from the previous part consistent
with your spaghetti plot? Explain briefly.</li>
</ol>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>The thing that the interaction means is that the effect of
treatment is different over different times. That shows up in the
spaghetti plot by treatment C being the same as the others at the
beginning, but clearly better than the others at the later
times. That is to say, you can’t talk about “an” effect of
treatment, because whether or not treatment C is better than the
others depends on which time you’re looking at.</p>
<p>Extra: we used the MANOVA way of doing the repeated-measures
analysis. There is another way, “mixed models”, which is in some
ways less familiar and in some ways more.</p>
<p>In any analysis of variance, there are two kinds of effects of
things you may care about: fixed effects and random effects. Fixed
effects are things like the treatment and time here, where the
ones you look at are the only ones you are interested in (in this
study at least). If you had wanted to assess another treatment,
you would have designed it into the study; if you cared about
other times, you would have measured <code>y</code> at those times
too. The subjects, though, are different: they are a random sample
of all possible people, and you want your results to generalize to
the population of all people of whom your subjects are a
sample.
<label for="tufte-mn-205" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-205" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">In practice, things are usually fuzzier than this, because the subjects in your study are typically the ones you could get, rather than being a physical random sample of all possible people, but we usually act as if our subjects are a random sample of all possible subjects.</span>
So subjects are a different kind of thing and they have what are
called random effects. When each subject only gives one
measurement, as in all the things we’ve seen so
far,
<label for="tufte-mn-206" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-206" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">Including matched pairs, because what we do there is to take the difference between the two measurements for each person and throw away the actual measurements themselves, so that each subject still only gives us one measurement.</span> it
doesn’t matter how you treat (statistically) the subjects, but
when each subject gives <em>more</em> than one measurement, it does
matter. Which is why we have to do the <code>idesign</code> stuff in
the MANOVA, or what you will see below.</p>
<p>A model with both fixed and random effects is called a mixed model.</p>
<p>We’re going to make the assumption that the effect of being one
subject rather than another is to move the value of <code>y</code> up
or down by a fixed amount regardless of treatment or time, on
average (each subject is different, but <em>within</em> a subject
the random effect is the same size). That seems reasonable, given
the spaghetti plot, where some subjects seemed to give
consistently larger or smaller values of <code>y</code> than
others. This is a so-called “random-intercepts” model. In the
package <code>lme4</code>, there is a function <code>lmer</code> that
looks like <code>lm</code>, except for the way in which you specify
the random effects. It looks like this, noting that  that we read in from the file and made
the spaghetti plot out of:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb3624"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb3624-1" data-line-number="1">treatment<span class="fl">.4</span> &lt;-<span class="st"> </span><span class="kw">lmer</span>(y <span class="op">~</span><span class="st"> </span>trt <span class="op">*</span><span class="st"> </span>time <span class="op">+</span><span class="st"> </span>(<span class="dv">1</span> <span class="op">|</span><span class="st"> </span>subject), <span class="dt">data =</span> treatments)</a>

<pre><code>## Single term deletions

<p>The way to read that model is “<code>y</code> depends on the combination of treatment and time and also on a random intercept for each subject”.
This is the way in which the model captures the idea that
each subject is different.</p>
<p>You don’t get a test for the random effects; you are assuming that the
subjects will be different from each other and you want to adjust for
that.
<label for="tufte-mn-207" class="margin-toggle">⊕</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-mn-207" class="margin-toggle"><span class="marginnote">This is rather like the test for blocks in a randomized block design: you want to <em>allow</em> for differences among blocks, but you don’t especially care to test that there <em>are</em> any. In fact, blocks are a lot like subjects, in that they are typically things like different experimental plots in which plants are grown, or different days on which the experiment is conducted, and you want to generalize from the blocks you observed, which are certainly <em>not</em> all possible blocks, to the population of all possible blocks.</span>
All you get is tests for the fixed effects that are currently up for
grabs, in this case the interaction, which is strongly significant.</p>
