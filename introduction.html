<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 1</span> Introduction</h1>
<p>This book will hold a collection of problems, and my solutions to them, in applied statistics with R. These come from my courses STAC32 and STAD29 at the University of Toronto Scarborough.</p>
<p>The problems were originally written in Sweave (that is, LaTeX with R code chunks), using the <code>exam</code> document class. I wrote <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nxskok/pasias/master/convert.pl">a Perl program</a> to strip out the LaTeX and turn each problem into R Markdown for this book. You will undoubtedly see bits of LaTeX still embedded in the text. I am trying to update my program to catch them, but I am sure to miss some. If you see anything, <a href="https://github.com/nxskok/pasias/issues">file an issue</a> on the Github page for now. I want to fix problems programmatically at first, but when the majority of the problems have been caught, I will certainly take pull requests. I will acknowledge all the people who catch things.</p>
<p>It looks as if everything compiles, but how does it look?</p>
<p>The next thing to nail down is converting LaTeX cross-references to R Markdown ones. Some reading required first. (I refer to other parts in the questions from time to time, and I want to do that properly in case I add new parts.) I am stuck as to how to do that. I can translate a <code>\label</code> into HTML as <code>&lt;a name=&quot;thing&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>, and I can refer to it with <code>[my_thing](#thing)</code>, and it works, but <code>\ref{part:this}</code> is trickier, because I need not just the <code>part:this</code> (which gains a <code>#</code> on the front and goes in the <code>()</code> brackets), but I need something like <code>(c)</code> to go into the <code>my_thing</code> slot, and I don’t know how to get that programmatically, since that seems internal to LaTeX.</p>
<p>I don’t think <code>pandoc</code> can help me here, because I can’t even get it to convert the output of Sweave (a <code>.tex</code> file) into Markdown.</p>
<p>I have an extremely hacky “solution” to this for now: replace any <code>\ref{}</code> I find with <code>????</code> in the R Markdown, so that when I see it, I can hand-convert it. Ugh.</p>
<p>&lt;= a7 done. There don’t seem to be many ordinary regressions yet (most of them are tied up into writing reports).</p>
