# Discriminant analysis

Packages for this chapter:

```{r}
library(ggbiplot)
library(MASS)
library(tidyverse)
library(car)
```

(Note: `ggbiplot` loads `plyr`, which overlaps a lot with `dplyr`
(`filter`, `select` etc.). We want the `dplyr` stuff elsewhere, so we
load `ggbiplot` *first*, and the things in `plyr` get hidden, as shown
in the Conflicts. This, despite appearances, is what we want.)
