 How can we predict an individual's body fat? Physiologists
measured body fat for 20 individuals, along with three other
quantitative measurements: triceps skinfold thickness, thigh
circumference and midarm circumference. (Measuring body fat requires a
special device, but the other variables are easy to measure and might
give a good estimate of body fat.) The data can be found at
[link](http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/bodyfat2.txt). The data
values are separated by *tabs*.



(a) Read in (to SAS) and display the data. (You may display all
the data.)


Solution


Something like this. Remember the `delimiter` line that
you need for tabs:
\begin{Datastep}
filename myurl url 'http://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/~butler/c32/bodyfat2.txt';
proc import
datafile=myurl
out=bodyfat
dbms=dlm
replace;
getnames=yes;
delimiter='09'x;
\end{Datastep}
\begin{Sascode}[store=qonut]
proc print;        
\end{Sascode}
\Listing[store=qonut, fontsize=footnotesize]{qonutt}
As indicated, 20 observations, and all the variables
quantitative. 



(b) Fit a regression predicting body fat from all the other
variables. 


Solution


`proc reg`, nothing very surprising:
\begin{Sascode}[store=kufez]
proc reg;
model Bodyfat=Triceps Thigh Midarm;
\end{Sascode}
\Listing[store=kufez, fontsize=footnotesize]{kufezz}



(c) What is R-squared for this regression? Look at the P-values
for the individual explanatory variables. Does this seem surprising?
Explain briefly.


Solution


R-squared is about 80\% (0.8014), decently high. But *none*
of the explanatory variables are significant; the lowest P-value
is 0.1699. This seems surprising because if the regression fits
reasonably well, as this one does, you would expect at least one
of the explanatory variables to be significant. (The reason, if
you wish to make a guess, is that at least two of the explanatory
variables are highly correlated with each other, so that we
don't know which one deserves the "credit" for predicting body
fat. We'll explore this later.)
SAS is not case sensitive, so you don't need those Initial
Capital Letters on the variable names.
I would have guessed that larger body fat would go with larger
measurements on the other variables, so I would have expected
those slopes to be positive. We'll keep an eye on this.



(d) Remove the least significant explanatory variable from your
regression. What has happened to the P-values for the other
explanatory variables? 


Solution


This means fitting a model without `Thigh`. SAS doesn't
have `update`, so this means copying and pasting your
code and deleting `Thigh`:
\begin{Sascode}[store=gufow]
proc reg;
model Bodyfat=Triceps Midarm;
\end{Sascode}
\Listing[store=gufow, fontsize=footnotesize]{gufoww}
The P-values for the remaining two explanatory variables have
become (much) smaller. In particular, the P-value for
`Triceps` is now *strongly* significant.
This suggests that `Triceps` was strongly correlated with
the variable `Thigh` that we removed. We can investigate this:
\begin{Sascode}[store=guyuy]
proc sgplot;
scatter x=Thigh y=Triceps;
\end{Sascode}
\Graphic[store=guyuy, scale=0.7]{guyuyuy}
That's a decently strong correlation: when one variable is high,
the other one is too. That's why it was difficult for the
regression to decide which of `Thigh` and
`Triceps` deserved to stay.
I note that the slope for
`Midarm` is still negative, and now significant, so it
really does seem to be true that if you have a larger midarm
circumference, you have *less* body fat, all else (triceps
skinfold thickness) being equal.



(e) Make any other changes you would like to make to your
regression model, or explain briefly why you are happy with the
model as it stands. 


Solution


Both of the remaining explanatory variables are now significant,
so it would be a mistake to remove either of them. We are
therefore happy with the model as it stands.
(This statement is really only worth one point, but I didn't
want to give it away: if you thought you needed to fit another
model and that had been correct, you would have deserved two
points for doing it.)



(f) For your preferred model, critically assess whether your
residuals are (i) approximately random with respect to suitable
things and (ii) approximately normal. You probably already have the
output you need to investigate this. What do your conclusions tell
you about your regression?


Solution


It's those graphs from the last regression you did:
\Graphic[store=gufow, scale=0.7]{gufowx}
On the first $3 \times 3$ "panel", look at the top left
graph. This is the plot of residuals against fitted values. It
is pretty much a random scatter. Also look at the last two
plots; these are the residuals against the two remaining
explanatory variables, and they both look random as well. (The
one on the left, against `Triceps`, is pretty much a
textbook random scatter).
This all says that the residuals are random relative to anything
relevant, or to say it another way, there is no remaining
pattern that we need to incorporate in the model. To assess the
residuals for normality, look at the normal quantile plot, which
is the first plot on the second row of the $3\times 3$
array.\endnote{I mistyped this as "arrau", and was reminded
that there was a famous Chilean pianist called Claudio
Arrau. Here he is playing Beethoven's "Waldstein" sonata:
[link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL0JLNt_3EE). The people
behind him are part of the audience, rather than, as is
usually the case, the orchestra. I'm guessing that those are
cheaper seats, because the lid of a grand piano always opens
up so that the best sound comes if the pianist is (from your
point of view as an audience member) on the left of the piano.} 
The normal quantile plot is basically straight, I would say,
with those wiggles being inconsequential ones, not indicative of
any kind of curve. If the distribution had short tails, there
would be a rather more pronounced S-shape than you see here.
The bottom left plot of the $3 \times 3$ array is a histogram of
the residuals. This does not look very normal, but, as we have
seen, the histogram is rather a crude tool for assessing
normality. 
Concluding, as we have, that there are no problems with the
residuals means that the regression is satisfactory; it does a
good job of describing the shape of the relationship. So we
should be happy to use this regression to predict body fat of
future individuals based on their triceps and midarm
measurements.
